You open a door and you find yourself dead on the floor. Your body is years older. You hear a car door slam. You look out the window, and its you as a kid. You're mother is thin. She is carrying groceries. You are both sassy and laughing. You are smittem by her.

//It was a perfect fresh fish. It was gutted and scaled.

You try to be present, but you are like a ghost to them.
You watch you're mother put away groceries. You hear her sing riddle songs and you watch yourself gaze at your mothers lips as she sounds out the words. Yourself, laughs with her and fixates on tthe movmement of her lips. Then you sing your part of the song and you both laugh.

You can hear the faucet running on low. Your mother is washing lettuce. You watch her prepare a batter of soft flour and lay it by the stove. She cracks two eggs into a glass jar. They were lain this morning by a hen from thier backyard. The yolks are orange like a setting western sun. There is a skillet on the stove, you can hear it sizzle and you can smell the peanut oil roast.

You see a fresh a fish, cleaned, driping cold spring water then patted dry. You see your mother dip the fish into the orange yolk then layed to fluff on the batter of soft flour. You watch the battered fish hang over the bubbling oil. You hear the violent sizzles of the batter drop it the hot skillet. You see the fish drop and fry in the boiling pot of oil.

You see a wooden pot holder on the dry wood kitchen table. Your grandfather made that. You see the fish sizzling in the pot placed on the potholder. Drops of peanut oil burst onto the dry wood table. They are rubbed in by elbows and palms reaching for more wine.

You watch your uncle, young, drink lastnights left over wine.
You hear the faucet run and you see the kitchen clean.
You see the night end and one day go by.

You hear a knock on the door and you see your brother and his family.  You smile with his wife and you give thier only child a sweet treat. You see him smile and you see that his smile is genuine and without controll. You see that he is smitten by you.

You sit at the dry kitchen table for lunch. You share stories and laugh about your parents. You watch your nephew swell up, struggle for his breath, and die from a peanut allergy. You watch his parents violently try and save him. You watch their deepest efforts to save him. You watch them weep by his dead body. You hear them sream at their god.


You walk upstairs, open a door and you find yourself dead on the floor.
